# Solidity X days to master solidity
by Brian Seong

I have been in touch with solidity since the beginning on 2021, where I was trying to get into NFT, at that time I knew what blockchain was but didn't have a clear picture of the entire tech stack.

Ever since I was hired by Polygon to work as Developer Relations Engineer, I was going in and out with solidity, I would learn what I was going to teach others in my workshop events. Quite Immature and not informative enough I'd say.

Currently I am a full time masters student and have a little side job, I wish to do a systematic overview of Solidity and go through its basics, advance, security topics, and possibly code some examples in the shortest time possible.

# Progress

## Basics

### Day1: Getting the basics (30-40 mins)

The goal of this day is to get a grasp of basic logics, terminologies of Solidity, but not in depth, we will get in touch with the more complicated topics in later days when needed, for now we just need to know a general picture of what Solidity is. Read [this](./SolidityBasics.sol) and make sure to click on the links mentioned in the file, will help you understand better.

Keywords: Solidity Layout, Data types, Events, Modifiers, Functions, Struct, Enums.
